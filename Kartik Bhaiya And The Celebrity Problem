/*

Kartik Bhaiya, mentor at Coding Blocks, organized a party for their interns at Coding Blocks. In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, she/he doesn’t know anyone in the party. We can only ask questions like “does A know B? “.
Find the stranger (celebrity) in minimum number of questions.

Input Format
First line contains N, number of persons in party. Next line contains the matrix of N x N which represents A knows B when it's value is one.

Constraints
None

Output Format
Print the celebrity ID which is between 0 and N-1. If celebrity is not present then print "No Celebrity".

Sample Input
4
0 0 1 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
Sample Output
2
Explanation
In the given case there are 4 persons in the party let them as A, B, C, D. The matrix represents A knows B when it's value is one. From the matrix, A knows C, B knows C and D knows C. Thus C is the celebrity who doesnot know anyone and it's ID is 2. Hence output is 2.
