Input Format
Constraints
0 < N <= 1000000000

Output Format
Sample Input
2635

Sample Output
11
5

Explanation
5 is present at 1st position, 3 is present at 2nd position, 6 is present at 3rd position and 2 is present at 4th position.

Sum of odd placed digits on first line. 5 and 6 are placed at odd position. Hence odd place sum is 5+6=11

Sum of even placed digits on second line. 3 and 2 are placed at even position. Hence even place sum is 3+2=5
